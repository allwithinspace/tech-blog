<p style="color: blue; font-weight: bold"><u>About this blog</u></p>
<p style="color: purple">This blog is an humble offering with documenting my experiences visiting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paadal_Petra_Sthalam">Thevara Padal Petra Sthalams</a> dedicated to Lord Shiva. I would like to recount my personal experiences of visiting these temples in this blog and will make a sincere attempt to document as much as possible about the history of these temples, the thevaram hymns sung by the great nayanmars and any pictures taken during my visit. I'm doing this for my own self-satisfaction (atma thrupthi) and in no means publishing this as a reference or as a wealth of knowledge. I leave it to the readers' discretion on consuming the information published in this blog site. I pray to Him and wish that I can have the darshan of all 276 temples within this life time and be able to recount my experiences through this blog !!</p>

<p style="color: blue; font-weight: bold"><u>About Allwithinspace</u></p>
<p style="color: purple">In Hinduism, Space (Sanskrit: Akasha) means the basis and essence of all things in the material world; the first material element created from the astral world, (Akasha (Ether), Air, Fire, Water, Earth) in sequence). It is one of the Panchamahabhuta, or "five elements"; its main characteristic is Shabda (sound). So "All within Space" is symbolic of this phenomenon and being the first element of His creation that contains everything which itself is infinite.</p>
